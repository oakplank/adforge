Brand: PartingWord (https://www.partingword.com/) - an end-of-life messaging platform focused on compassionate legacy communication. Category: Websites & Digital Services (general). Creative concept: Lifestyle-in-context showing the outcome the service enables. Product focus: PartingWord caregivers practical care guidance future notes. Context: PartingWord for caregivers with practical care guidance and future notes for family coordinators, warm home realism.. Interpretation intent: help people preserve meaningful words for loved ones with dignity and calm trust. Visual promise: Show care, continuity, and emotional safety without fear-based imagery.. Primary scene blueprint: A quiet preparation moment where hands seal a personal letter beside a keepsake box, lived-in home materials, soft side light, and emotionally grounded realism. Background directive: Background should feel real and human: natural materials, subtle depth, low-detail text lane, no sterile studio emptiness, no device screens or UI symbols.. Scene variation options: A quiet preparation moment where hands seal a personal letter beside a keepsake box, lived-in home materials, soft side light, and emotionally grounded realism | A candid home-writing moment with one adult hand actively writing a heartfelt note in a journal, dark-green linen accents, cream-beige paper texture, and natural window light | A reflective bedside scene with one partially visible person reviewing a handwritten message card, tactile fabrics, warm practical lamp glow, and low-clutter background. Interpretive direction selected: Keepsake Archive. Intent resolution: Communicate secure, compassionate legacy messaging through one coherent human-centered scene.. Ambiguity flags: multi_clause_prompt. Refined scene instruction: Show one keepsake preparation scene: one hero keepsake box with one partially visible note, tactile fabrics, dark green and cream-beige palette, and grounded realism.. Do not include: floating app icons, email glyphs, tablet/phone/laptop hero devices, mixed metaphor props from different scenes, centered stock-style tabletop symmetry, sterile white-background product still life. Pre-render thought session (must be satisfied before image creation): Target audience: caregivers. Decision summary: Audience-first awareness narrative for caregivers, resolved as \"Keepsake Archive\" with partial_person human presence and high documentary-style photorealism with compassionate editorial polish.. Narrative moment: a real moment of preparing a meaningful future message in a lived-in home environment. Human presence policy: partial_person. Realism level: high documentary-style photorealism with compassionate editorial polish. Realism cues to include: natural hand posture and non-posed gestures | subtle material wear (paper grain, leather texture, wood imperfections) | soft shadow falloff from real window or practical light sources. Subject priority: hero subject should feel meaningful and emotionally grounded, occupying 38-52% of the frame. Background priority: background should provide lived-in emotional context while keeping a clean low-detail text lane. Lighting approach: soft directional natural light with gentle contrast, avoiding harsh dramatic stylization. Composition approach: asymmetric narrative composition with one-third subject bias, no centered tabletop default, and intentional breathing room. Regenerate instead of forcing output if any trigger occurs: scene appears as isolated object on blank/white sterile background | composition defaults to centered static tabletop symmetry | human presence policy is violated or feels staged | text lane has noisy gradients/bokeh that harm readability | props conflict with narrative moment or audience context | any legible text, quote overlay, logo, watermark, or UI glyph appears in-scene | a hard vertical split panel, border, matte band, or letterbox appears. Audience focus: caregivers. Objective: awareness. Subject: person experiencing the service outcome. Treatment: environmental lifestyle with natural behavior. Mood: warm. Emotional tone: trust and possibility. Visual energy: medium. Color temperature: warm. Visual direction: structured, trustworthy, minimal, premium corporate. Typography reference: clean geometric sans with left-aligned hierarchy. Photography style: premium commercial product photography. Lighting: balanced key-fill-rim setup for clean dimensionality. Background: minimal intentional backdrop with low clutter. Color direction: clean neutral base with a disciplined accent. Brand palette accents: #1E4D3A, #F1E9DA. Depth of field: medium depth of field with clear subject emphasis. Composition strategy: Wide environmental framing with generous negative space for copy lanes.. Framing priority: headline-first. CTA placement: bottom-right or bottom-center, low footprint. Aspect ratio 1:1. Format framing: Center-weighted focal point with controlled top/bottom lanes.. Text lanes: top headline, bottom action line. Use full-bleed edge-to-edge composition with no border, no frame, no letterbox bars, and no matte color bands. Do not default to centered static tabletop framing; use purposeful asymmetry and environmental storytelling. Do not produce sterile isolated object-on-white-background imagery unless explicitly requested by the user prompt. Use one coherent narrative scene with one primary anchor object and supporting props from the same world. Do not mix app UI symbols with unrelated physical props. Human presence should be subtle and natural (hands or partial person), not staged. Do not render tablets, phones, laptops, floating app icons, email glyphs, or glowing UI overlays. Avoid perfectly centered hero placement unless explicitly requested; bias subject to one third to preserve clean text lanes. The right 45% of the frame must maintain consistent low-detail tonality for high-contrast text overlay. Avoid gradient shifts, bokeh orbs, and texture changes in this zone. Text-supporting negative space must come from a natural scene surface (wall, curtain, sky, soft depth), never a synthetic split-screen panel, hard vertical wipe, or artificial side bar. Keep the top 18% and bottom 24% visually clean for text overlays. Keep the hero subject in the middle zone and avoid busy textures in headline/CTA lanes. Category insight: Service ads convert when viewers see themselves in the moment.. Authenticity: visible natural material texture, non-posed realism, and believable lighting falloff. Avoid visual clutter, stock-photo energy, cheap marketplace look, symmetrical-by-default framing, and unreadable backgrounds. No visible words, letters, numerals, logos, signage, subtitles, captions, quote overlays, or watermark-like marks anywhere in the image. If paper, books, labels, or screens appear, any marks must be abstract/illegible only. No text overlays, no logos, no watermarks, no UI elements. Photorealistic, campaign-quality, professional location-or-studio photography.","systemPrompt":"You are the creative director at a top-tier performance marketing agency producing platform-native paid social visuals. Objective priority: awareness. Style profile: Modern Brand (structured, trustworthy, minimal, premium corporate). Brand tone: PartingWord should feel empathetic, dignified, and trustworthy. Use #1E4D3A and #F1E9DA as dominant palette references. First run a silent pre-render thought session before writing the final scene: decide target audience, narrative moment, human presence level, realism level, lighting plan, and subject/background balance. Then choose a scene that communicates product outcome and emotional truth for that audience. Avoid repetitive static compositions. Keep narrative logic consistent: one scene, one clear subject, no random symbolic collisions. Reject bland defaults (single object on plain white background, centered tabletop symmetry) unless user explicitly asks for that style. Never output synthetic split-screen side panels, matte borders, letterboxing, or hard-edge vertical wipes intended to fake text lanes. Never output legible text in-scene (including quotes, labels, signage, handwriting, UI text, or watermark-like artifacts). Hard constraints: no text, no logos, no watermark, no cheap ecommerce aesthetic, no generic stock-photo energy. Keep negative space intentional so downstream layout can place headline, subhead, and CTA. When uncertain, prefer authentic imperfection over decorative polish.","styleProfileId":"modern-brand","styleProfileName":"Modern Brand","qualityChecklist":["Maintain premium look and avoid low-end
