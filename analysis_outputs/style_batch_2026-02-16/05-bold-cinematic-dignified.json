  "renderPrompt": "Create a premium Instagram ad base image. Brand: PartingWord (https://www.partingword.com/) - an end-of-life messaging platform focused on compassionate legacy communication. Category: Websites & Digital Services (general). Creative concept: Lifestyle-in-context showing the outcome the service enables. Product focus: PartingWord. Context: PartingWord.com launch campaign for preserving your voice and words, bold cinematic but dignified mood, dramatic yet compassionate interior lighting, dark green and cream beige colors.. Interpretation intent: help people preserve meaningful words for loved ones with dignity and calm trust. Visual promise: Show care, continuity, and emotional safety without fear-based imagery.. Primary scene blueprint: A quiet preparation moment where hands seal a personal letter beside a keepsake box, lived-in home materials, soft side light, and emotionally grounded realism. Background directive: Background should feel real and human: natural materials, subtle depth, low-detail text lane, no sterile studio emptiness, no device screens or UI symbols.. Scene variation options: A quiet preparation moment where hands seal a personal letter beside a keepsake box, lived-in home materials, soft side light, and emotionally grounded realism | A candid home-writing moment with one adult hand actively writing a heartfelt note in a journal, dark-green linen accents, cream-beige paper texture, and natural window light | A reflective bedside scene with one partially visible person reviewing a handwritten message card, tactile fabrics, warm practical lamp glow, and low-clutter background. Interpretive direction selected: Letter Ritual. Intent resolution: Communicate secure, compassionate legacy messaging through one coherent human-centered scene.. Ambiguity flags: multi_clause_prompt. Refined scene instruction: Show a single intimate letter-writing ritual in a real home setting: one hero object (journal or letter), one supporting pen, soft natural light, and clear emotional calm.. Do not include: floating app icons, email glyphs, tablet/phone/laptop hero devices, mixed metaphor props from different scenes, centered stock-style tabletop symmetry, sterile white-background product still life. Pre-render thought session (must be satisfied before image creation): Target audience: preserving your voice and words. Decision summary: Audience-first launch narrative for preserving your voice and words, resolved as \"Letter Ritual\" with hands_only human presence and high documentary-style photorealism with compassionate editorial polish.. Narrative moment: a real moment of preparing a meaningful future message in a lived-in home environment. Human presence policy: hands_only. Realism level: high documentary-style photorealism with compassionate editorial polish. Realism cues to include: natural hand posture and non-posed gestures | subtle material wear (paper grain, leather texture, wood imperfections) | soft shadow falloff from real window or practical light sources. Subject priority: hero subject should feel meaningful and emotionally grounded, occupying 38-52% of the frame. Background priority: background should provide lived-in emotional context while keeping a clean low-detail text lane. Lighting approach: soft directional natural light with gentle contrast, avoiding harsh dramatic stylization. Composition approach: asymmetric narrative composition with one-third subject bias, no centered tabletop default, and intentional breathing room. Regenerate instead of forcing output if any trigger occurs: scene appears as isolated object on blank/white sterile background | composition defaults to centered static tabletop symmetry | human presence policy is violated or feels staged | text lane has noisy gradients/bokeh that harm readability | props conflict with narrative moment or audience context. Audience focus: preserving your voice and words. Objective: launch. Subject: person experiencing the service outcome. Treatment: environmental lifestyle with natural behavior. Mood: bold. Emotional tone: trust and possibility. Visual energy: medium. Color temperature: mixed. Visual direction: structured, trustworthy, minimal, premium corporate. Typography reference: clean geometric sans with left-aligned hierarchy. Photography style: premium commercial product photography. Lighting: balanced key-fill-rim setup for clean dimensionality. Background: minimal intentional backdrop with low clutter. Color direction: clean neutral base with a disciplined accent. Brand palette accents: #1E4D3A, #F1E9DA, #2E7D32. Depth of field: medium depth of field with clear subject emphasis. Composition strategy: Slight asymmetry and unconventional crop to stop the scroll.. Framing priority: attention-first. CTA placement: minimal embedded action line. Aspect ratio 4:5. Format framing: Vertical sandwich layout with clean top and bottom safe zones.. Text lanes: top headline zone, bottom action zone, optional left subhead rail. Use full-bleed edge-to-edge composition with no border, no frame, no letterbox bars, and no matte color bands. Do not default to centered static tabletop framing; use purposeful asymmetry and environmental storytelling. Do not produce sterile isolated object-on-white-background imagery unless explicitly requested by the user prompt. Use one coherent narrative scene with one primary anchor object and supporting props from the same world. Do not mix app UI symbols with unrelated physical props. Human presence should be subtle and natural (hands or partial person), not staged. Do not render tablets, phones, laptops, floating app icons, email glyphs, or glowing UI overlays. Avoid perfectly centered hero placement unless explicitly requested; bias subject to one third to preserve clean text lanes. The right 45% of the frame must maintain consistent low-detail tonality for high-contrast text overlay. Avoid gradient shifts, bokeh orbs, and texture changes in this zone. Keep the top 18% and bottom 25% visually clean for text overlays. Keep the hero subject in the middle zone and avoid busy textures in headline/CTA lanes. Category insight: Service ads convert when viewers see themselves in the moment.. Authenticity: visible natural material texture, non-posed realism, and believable lighting falloff. Avoid visual clutter, stock-photo energy, cheap marketplace look, symmetrical-by-default framing, and unreadable backgrounds. No text overlays, no logos, no watermarks, no UI elements. Photorealistic, campaign-quality, professional location-or-studio photography."
